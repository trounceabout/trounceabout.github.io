                <h2 class="text-7xl">I use design to make experiences better for people.</h2>
                <p class="text-2xl">During my career as a designer, I’ve gone from graphic design to web design to motion design, and back again. Experiencing such a wide variety of design disciplines has given me a broad understanding of what design is, and how to use it to make better experiences.</p>
                <p class="text-2xl">Over the course of my time being a designer, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many tools and systems to create digital assets and interfaces. I have experience with Figma, Adobe Illustrator and After Effects, Sketch, Asana, Jira, Notion, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
